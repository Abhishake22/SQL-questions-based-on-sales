Query: Find the customers who have made purchases in consecutive months.

SELECT c.customer_id,c.customer_name
FROM customers c
JOIN purchases p1
ON c.customer_id = p1.customer_id
JOIN purchases p2
ON c.customer_id = p2.customer_id
WHERE DATEPART(YEAR,p1.purchase_date) = DATEPART(YEAR,p2.purchase_date)
AND DATEPART(MONTH,p1.purchase_date) = DATEPART(MONTH,p2.purchase_date) -1 


Explanation:

This query joins the "Customers" table with the "Purchases" table twice, once for each consecutive month comparison. 
It compares the purchase dates of the customer's purchases in two consecutive months, 
ensuring that they are from the same year and the second month is one month ahead of the first month.
